# 🧠 Advanced Application of JavaScript - Dynamic To-Do List Application

## 📘 Project Overview

This project, **Advanced Application of JavaScript**, focuses on the development of a **dynamic To-Do List application**. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to create interactive and data-driven web applications using **advanced JavaScript techniques**.

The application allows users to **add**, **display**, and **remove** tasks while maintaining data persistence through the **localStorage API**. This ensures that user tasks remain available even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

Through this project, learners will strengthen their understanding of **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **localStorage** as key aspects of modern web development.
